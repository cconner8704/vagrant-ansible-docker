#make showver           will show the current release tag based on the directory content.

#make build             builds a new version of your Docker image and tags it
#make snapshot          build from the current (dirty) workspace and pushes the image to the registry
#make release           build the current release and push the image to the registry

#make patch-release     increments the patch release level, build and push to registry

#make tag-patch-release increments the patch release level, without build and push to registry
